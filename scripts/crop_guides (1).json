      "id": "early_blight",
      "name": "Early Blight",
      "symptoms": "Small, dark spots with concentric rings that look like a target. It usually starts on the oldest leaves near the ground and turns them yellow.",
      "cause": "A soil-borne fungus called Alternaria solani.",
      "organic_treatment": "Prune infected lower leaves and apply Neem oil or a baking soda spray to reduce spread.",
      "chemical_treatment": "Apply fungicides containing Chlorothalonil or Copper-based sprays every 7 to 10 days.",
      "prevention": "Rotate crops every 2 years, use mulch to prevent soil splash, and avoid overhead watering."

      "symptoms": "Numerous small, circular spots with dark borders and greyish-white centers. Tiny black specks may appear inside the spots.",
      "cause": "A fungus that thrives in high humidity and wet foliage.",
      "organic_treatment": "Remove and destroy all infected leaves immediately. Improve airflow by staking the plants.",

    "The name of the disease is Septoria leaf spot caused by a fungus that thrives in high humidity and wet foliage. The symptoms include numerous small, circular spots with dark borders and greyish-white centers, with tiny black specks that may appear inside the spots. Organic treatment involves removing and destroying all infected leaves immediately and improving airflow by staking the plants.

      "id": "late_blight",
      "name": "Late Blight",
      "symptoms": "Large, irregular greenish-black water-soaked patches on leaves. In humid weather, a white fuzzy growth may appear on the leaf undersides.",
      "cause": "An aggressive water mold (Phytophthora infestans).",
      "organic_treatment": "There is no cure. Pull out the entire plant and bag it immediately to prevent spore travel.",
      "chemical_treatment": "Preventative spraying with Copper fungicides is effective, but once the disease is visible, chemicals rarely save the plant.",
      "prevention": "Plant resistant varieties and destroy all potato tubers or volunteer tomatoes from the previous year."

      "id": "bacterial_spot",
      "name": "Bacterial Spot",
      "symptoms": "Small, water-soaked spots that eventually turn dark brown and look 'scabby' or greasy. Can also cause spots on the fruit.",
      "cause": "Bacteria spread by wind-blown rain and contaminated tools.",
      "organic_treatment": "Apply a liquid copper spray. Remove any heavily infected plants to protect the rest of the crop.",
      "chemical_treatment": "A combination spray of Copper and Mancozeb is the standard treatment.",
      "prevention": "Only plant certified disease-free seeds and avoid handling plants when they are wet with dew or rain."

      "symptoms": "Leaves are vibrant green, firm, and free of spots, holes, or fuzzy growth.",

      "organic_treatment": "Maintain current care routine.",
      "chemical_treatment": "No chemicals required.",
      "prevention": "Continue to clean your gardening tools after each use and monitor for pests like aphids weekly."
